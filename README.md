This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases information about the world of Middle-earth from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The application uses the Lord of the Rings API to retrieve data about characters, locations, and events from the books and then stores this information in the local storage for easy access.

Features
Simple homepage with link to other official LOTR articles
Display a list of characters with their names, races, and descriptions
Show a catalogue of important books
Store data in local storage for easy access and improved performance

Technical Details
The project uses HTML to structure the content and provide a basic layout. CSS is used to style the web page and provide a visually appealing user interface. JavaScript is used to retrieve data from the Lord of the Rings API, store it in the local storage, and dynamically display it on the page. The application makes use of asynchronous JavaScript to ensure that the data is loaded from the API before it is displayed on the page.
